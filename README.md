# Operating Systems
Banker's Alorithm and a scheduler implemented in C++

## Description

* [Banker's Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banker%27s_algorithm) - 
Create a resource allocator using both an optimistic resource manager and the bankerâ€™s algorithm of Dijkstra.

* Scheduler - Simulate scheduling in order to see how the time required depends on the scheduling algorithm and the request patterns.
